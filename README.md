# Accelerating_material_properties_using_machine_learning
A crystal dataset with 215 optimised structures is provided to us. Predicting material properties is our goal. We create a supervised regressor model from the provided data in order to predict the characteristics of the test data. Here, my main focus has been on applying different descriptors to convert the provided data into acceptable data input.
The given data includes the goal variable, the number of C, H, and O atoms, and the atoms' x, y, and z coordinates.
